# Simple-Face-Detection
This code uses OpenCV and Python Code to detect a face on the screen. This serves as an example program.


## Important prerequisites

You'll need the ```haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml``` file, available in this repository.

You'll also need to specify the path to this file inside the code.

If you don't have OpenCV then you'll need to install that for Python as well ```pip install opencv-python```.
